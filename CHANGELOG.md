## [0.3.0] - 2025-09-26

### Added

- Initial commit for the 'using-delegates' assignment. Includes a C# console application that is incomplete and requires further development.
 (In future updates, meant to demonstrate the use of delegates to encapsulate method references, along with supporting project and solution files.)

## [0.2.1] - 2025-09-23

### Changed

- In the [Conditions and Iterations](Assignments/conditions-and-iterations/Program.cs) assignment moved inputExceptions ArrayList into getInput method and updated method signature to remove it as a parameter. This simplifies the function call and encapsulates input validation logic within the method.
- Expanded changelog entry for version 0.1.0 to provide more context on the initial commit.

### Added

- Added missing changelog entry for version 0.2.0.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-09-23

### Added

- Initial commit for the 'working-with-arrays' assignment. Includes a C# console application that demonstrates dynamic array resizing by appending user input, along with supporting project and solution files.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-09-22

### Changed

- Initial commit for the 'conditions-and-iterations' assignment. Includes a C# console application that demonstrates basic input validation and conditional logic, along with supporting project and solution files.
